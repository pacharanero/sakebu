Sakebu
======

An open source digital dictation manager in Rails, primarily aimed at the UK Healthcare sector, although its functions could easily find uses in other sectors. Sakebu allows user and group management and securely stores the metadata associated with a dictation sound file. It is intended to be a simpler open source alternative to Lexacom and Crescendo, which currently dominate the UK Healthcare dictation manager market.

By law all web apps in Rails must have a name that is a Japanese translation of an English word that describes the app: "Sakebu" means "shout" in Japanese.
